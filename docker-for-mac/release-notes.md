Here are the main improvements and issues per stable release, starting with the
current release. The documentation is updated for each release.

For system requirements, see
[What to know before you install](install.md#what-to-know-before-you-install).

Release notes for _stable_ releases are listed below, [_edge_ release
notes](edge-release-notes) are also available. (Following the Docker Engine - Community release model,
'beta' releases are called 'edge' releases.) You can learn about both kinds of
releases, and download stable and edge product installers at [Download Docker
Desktop for Mac](install.md#download-docker-for-mac).

### New

* Selecting the ‘Experimental features’ checkbox in the Daemon **Preferences** menu turns on experimental features for Docker daemon and Docker CLI.
* Improved the reliability of `com.docker.osxfs trace` performance profiling command. Users can now run the `com.docker.osxfs trace --summary` option for a high-level summary of operations, instead of receiving a trace of all operations.
* Docker Desktop now supports large lists of DNS resource records on Mac.  Fixes [docker/for-mac#2160](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/2160#issuecomment-431571031).

### Experimental

> Experimental features provide early access to future product functionality. These features are intended for testing and feedback only as they may change between releases without warning or can be removed entirely from a future release. Experimental features must not be used in production environments. Docker does not offer support for experimental features.

Docker Desktop Community 2.1.0.0 contains the following experimental features.

* Docker App: Docker App is a CLI plugin that helps configure, share, and install applications. For more information, see [Working with Docker App](/app/working-with-app/).
* Docker Buildx: Docker Buildx is a CLI plugin for extended build capabilities with BuildKit. For more information, see [Working with Docker Buildx](/buildx/working-with-buildx/).

### Bug fixes and minor changes

* Changed the host's kubernetes context so that `docker run -v .kube:kube ... kubectl` works.
* Restricted the `cluster-admin` role on local Kubernetes cluster to `kube-system` namespace.
* Reduced the VM startup time. swap is not created every time a virtual machine boots.
* Fixed Kubernetes installation with VPNkit subnet.
* Fixed a bug where the process output was not redirected to stdout when gathering diagnostics on Windows, which sometimes resulted in a crash.
* Added `/etc/machine-id` to the virtual machine. Fixes [docker/for-mac#3554](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/3554).
* Docker Desktop does not send DNS queries for `docker-desktop.<domain>` every 10s. It now relies on the host’s DNS domain search order rather than trying to replicate it inside the VM.
* Removed the ability to log in using email address as a username as the Docker command line does not support this.
* Docker Desktop now allows running a Docker registry inside a container. Fixes [docker/for-mac#3611](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/3611).
* Fixed a stability issue with the DNS resolver.
* Docker Desktop truncates UDP DNS responses which are over 512 bytes in sizes.
* Fixed port 8080 that was used on localhost when starting Kubernetes. Fixes [docker/for-mac#3522](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/3522).
* Improved error messaging: Docker Desktop does not prompt users to run diagnostics, or to reset to factory default when it is not appropriate.
* Kubernetes: Docker Desktop now uses the default maximum number of pods for kubelet. [docker/for-mac#3453](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/3453).
* Fixed DockerHelper crash. [docker/for-mac#3470](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/3470).
* Fixed binding of privileged ports with specified IP. [docker/for-mac#3464](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/3464)
* Fixed service log collection in diagnostics.
* Docker Desktop now gathers `/etc/hosts` to help with diagnostics.
* When two services have a common exposed port, Docker Desktop now exposes the available ports for the second service. [docker/for-mac#3438](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/3438).
* Docker Desktop ensures localhost resolves to 127.0.0.1. This is related to [docker/for-mac#2990](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/2990#issuecomment-443097942), [docker/for-mac#3383](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/3383).

### Docker Community Edition 17.12.0-ce-mac55 2018-02-27

[Download](https://download.docker.com/mac/stable/23011/Docker.dmg)

### Docker Community Edition 17.12.0-ce-mac49 2018-01-19

  - Allow individual IP addresses to be added to HTTP proxy excludes.
  - Avoid hitting DNS timeouts when querying docker.for.mac.* when the upstream DNS servers are slow or missing.

### Docker Community Edition 17.12.0-ce-mac47 2018-01-12

[Download](https://download.docker.com/mac/stable/21698/Docker.dmg)

* Bug fixes and minor changes
  - Fix for `docker push` to an insecure registry. Fixes [docker/for-mac#2392](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/2392)

### Docker Community Edition 17.12.0-ce-mac46 2018-01-09

[Download](https://download.docker.com/mac/stable/21698/Docker.dmg)

* Upgrades
  - [Docker 17.12.0-ce](https://github.com/docker/docker-ce/releases/tag/v17.12.0-ce)
  - [Docker compose 1.18.0](https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/tag/1.18.0)
  - [Docker Machine 0.13.0](https://github.com/docker/machine/releases/tag/v0.13.0)
  - Linux Kernel 4.9.60

* New
  - VM entirely built with Linuxkit
  - VM disk size can be changed in disk preferences. (See [docker/for-mac#1037](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/1037))
  - For systems running APFS on SSD on High Sierra, use `raw` format VM disks by default. This improves disk throughput (from 320MiB/sec to 600MiB/sec in `dd` on a 2015 MacBook Pro) and disk space handling.
  Existing disks are kept in qcow format, if you want to switch to raw format you need to "Remove all data" or "Reset to factory defaults". See https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/faqs/#disk-usage
  - DNS name `docker.for.mac.host.internal` should be used instead of `docker.for.mac.localhost` (still valid) for host resolution from containers, since since there is an RFC banning the use of subdomains of localhost. See  https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-west-let-localhost-be-localhost-06.

* Bug fixes and minor changes
  - Display various component versions in About box.
  - Avoid VM reboot when changing host proxy settings.
  - Don't break HTTP traffic between containers by forwarding them via the external proxy. (See [docker/for-mac#981](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/981))
  - Filesharing settings are now stored in settings.json.
  - Daemon restart button has been moved to settings / Reset Tab.
  - Better VM state handling & error messages in case of VM crashes.
  - Fix login into private repository with certificate issue. (See [docker/for-mac#2201](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/2201))
